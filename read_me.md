### **ShopEase Customer Churn Analysis \& Prediction:**



**This is a real-world inspired data science internship project for \*\*ShopEase\*\*, a fictional e-commerce company. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and build a machine learning model to predict customer churn.**

**Note:The project is currently in progress — core analysis is done, modeling and dashboarding are underway.**

**---**

**Business Scenario:**



**ShopEase processes over 50,000 monthly orders. As a data intern, I'm tasked with:**

**"Analyzing customer data to uncover behavioral patterns, visualize churn trends, and build a predictive model that flags customers likely to stop purchasing."**

**---**

**Tools \& Technologies: | Python (pandas, sklearn) | T-SQL | Power BI  | Excel**

**Tool/Technology**

**Purpose :| Data analysis \& ML modeling |Data extraction from SQL Server|Interactive dashboard creation |Quick reporting \& validation     |**

**---**

#### **Dataset:**



**- Source: \[Telco Customer Churn – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)**

**- Format: CSV**

**- Assumed to be loaded into SQL Server for query-based analysis**

**---**

#### **Project Tasks:**

#### **Data Analysis (Completed):**



**- Descriptive statistics and feature exploration using `pandas`**

**- Monthly active customer tracking**

**- Churn segmentation by contract type**

**- RFM-based clustering with K-Means**



#### **Machine Learning (In Progress ):**



**- Feature engineering and preprocessing**

**- Model training: Logistic Regression \& Random Forest**

**- Evaluation: Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC**

**- SHAP-based model interpretation**



#### **Dashboarding (Upcoming ):**

**- Power BI dashboard with dynamic filters**

**- KPI cards for churn rate, customer value, and contract type**

**- SQL views for backend integration**
